Upgraded to CGI::Ex 2.18
The applicaton breaks in CGI::Ex::App::conf when trying to read the configuration file.
Instead of returning the conf hash CGI::Ex::App::conf returned the configuration filename
Changed the corresponding line to be as in 2.17 to make it work.
I tested lately on another machine and this problem did not appear.
Removed conf_ext since now it is ext_conf and I really do not need it
All else runs as before.

Aded new method step_args which takes the rest of PATH_INFO and splits it into key/value pairs.
This will be very convenient for step modules to have some or all of their args in $self->step_args.
Added corresponding regex snippets to Recipes.conf
Also we will have better looking uris.

Added method pre_step to call the step_args early.

Prepared the application to run under mod_perl.
Added startup.pl and index.pl
Added example apache/mod_perl configuration.

Removed Build.PL and MANIFEST.
There will be another module which will install using CPAN.pm 
and will offer this application to be installed.

Fixed table name in CGI::Ex::Recipes::Delete;

Written a basic Install.pm.
Prepared a distribution for CPAN.
The distribution is using Install.pm to copy the example 
application wherever the user wants(See Makefile.PL).
The inspiration came from TT2's Makefile.PL.
Thanks, Andy!!!

Overwriten CGI::Ex::App::conf since it does not behaves 
(as expected) in CGI::Ex 2.18 and causes a die.
Added conditional debugging depending on configuration debug hash.
Changed next step of 'edit' to 'view' so after editing a recipe it is displayed.
Added new category ('VIM') to the recipes.sqlite database.

Enhanced CGI::Ex::Recipes::Install.
    Now it can install a fully independed application based on the application from which it is run.
    The shebang, $ENV{SITE_ROOT}, and package ourobscurepackage are replaced
    with values reflecting the perl interpreter with which install.pl was run 
    and the new installation directory. This is a primitive but effective way to run not colliding 
    applications even on the same virtual host and using the same interpreter under mod_perl.
Apache/mod_perl configuration section minimized to "SetHandler  perl-script..." for <Files "*.pl">
The startup.pl is now "require"ed in a BEGIN block in index.pl
As a result it is enough to have "AllowOverride All" in httpd.conf file or similar for a virtual host.

Added CGI::Ex::Recipes::Cache.
    This is the first module in the application that has tests.
Removed default t/ directory. Now tests are in erecipes/perl/t/*.t
