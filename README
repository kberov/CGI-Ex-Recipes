CGI-Ex-Recipes - A usage example for CGI::Ex::App!

This small but relatively complete application was inspired by the examples 
given by Paul in his documentation. I decided to go further and experiment with 
the recomendations and features which the framework provides. 
You are encouraged to play with it and use it as a starting point  for far more 
complex and customized applications.

INSTALLATION

The modules and scripts here are actually the example application. 
They can be just copied and pasted manually in an appropriate viewable by 
the server directory.

The other way is to use the install.pl script.
